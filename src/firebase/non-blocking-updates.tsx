// THIS FILE IS INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.
// The custom non-blocking update logic was found to be faulty and has been removed.
// We now use the native Firebase SDK functions (setDoc, addDoc, etc.) directly in the components
// with proper async/await and try/catch blocks to ensure reliable error handling.
// This file is kept to prevent breaking existing imports, but it no longer exports any functions.
